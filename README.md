# Camus challenge in Pytorch Lightning
Bare-bones Pytorch Lightning implementation of a Unet for the CAMUS challenge.
CAMUS is a challenge in ultrasound heart-structure segmentation. More info can be found on their [website](https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/Challenge/camus/index.html).

About the implementation: the performance isn't SotA - it serves as a baseline to get you started.
First suggested steps for improvement: add a data augmentation strategy.

## Getting started

Clone repo with git (bash):

```git clone https://github.com/GEJansen/camus-pytorch```

Download training and test set on their website.
